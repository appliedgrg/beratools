# Tool Template

## tool_template.py

This file provides a template for developing new geospatial tools in the BERA Tools framework.

## Purpose

- Serves as a starting point for custom tool development.
- Demonstrates reading, processing, and writing geospatial data.

## Features

- **GeoPandas Integration:** Reads and writes geospatial files.
- **Parallel Processing:** Uses Python's `multiprocessing` via `execute_multiprocessing` for faster operations.
- **Buffer Operation:** Applies a buffer to each feature in the input dataset.
- **Modular Design:** Main entry point is the `tool_name` function; processing logic is in `buffer_worker`.
- **GUI Integration:** Arguments are defined in `beratools.json` for GUI support.

## Usage

- Can be run as a standalone script or imported as a module.
- When executed directly, parses arguments and prints elapsed time.

## Developer Notes

- Update `gui/assets/beratools.json` for GUI integration.
- Refer to the developer's guide for implementation details.
