# BERA Tools

BERA Tools is a series of script tools for facilitating the high-resolution mapping and studying of forest lines (petroleum exploration corridors in forested areas) via processing canopy height models (LiDAR or photogrammetry derived raster images where pixel-values represent the ground-height of vegetation).

## Motivation

Given that the process of manually digitizing detailed small-scale
(boreal) forest lines is slow and prone to human error, a semi-automated
solution is preferred for large-scale application areas. Additionally,
high-resolution CHMs allow for improved forest line spatial analysis.

## BERA Tools overview

BERA Tools is a suite of utilities for mapping, analyzing, and processing forest linear disturbances. It provides both command-line and GUI interfaces, along with a set of modular tools for various workflows.
