# Check Seed Line

## What does this tool do?

## How do I use it?

### Quick Start

1. **Prepare your input file** (GeoPackage, Shapefile, etc.) with seed line features.
2. **Run the tool** from the GUI:

## What options can I set?

- **See Line**: Path to your input file
- **Output Seed Line**: Output line layer after QC

## Tips

- Works with line data (not points or polygons).
